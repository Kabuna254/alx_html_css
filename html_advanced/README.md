In this and coming projects, I am expected to implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.
For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.
This designer file will be available on Figma
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.
